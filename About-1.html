                As the makers of the world's largest selling biscuit, Parle-G, and a host of other very popular brands, the Parle name symbolizes quality, nutrition, and superior taste.
                An in-depth understanding of the Indian consumer psyche has helped us develop a marketing philosophy that reflects the needs of the Indian masses. We have made it a tradition to deliver both health and taste, with a value-for-money positioning that allows people from all classes and age groups to enjoy Parle products to the fullest.With a reach spanning the remotest villages of India and major cities across the world, the House of Parle has become synonymous with trust, globally.
                '''Parle Products was founded in 1929 in India by the Chauhan family of Vile Parle, Mumbai. The founder was Mohanlal Chauhan who hailed from Pardi near Valsad in Gujarat. He moved to Mumbai to make a living and at first, his profession was tailoring. However, it was not profitable, and so he moved into the food business by selling snacks. He ran a bakery making bread, buns, rusks, scones, nankhatai, turnovers, etc. He had five sons - Maneklal, Pitambar, Narottam, Kantilal and Jayantilal. The five brothers worked together under their father.

                Parle began manufacturing biscuits in 1939, with a license to supply their biscuits only to the British Army. In 1947, when India became independent, the company launched an ad campaign showcasing its Glucose biscuits as an Indian alternative to the British biscuits.[8] The Parle brand became well known in India following the success of products such as the Parle-G biscuits. Much later, in 1977, the Morarji Desai government expelled Coca-Cola from India. The family saw an opportunity here and opened their own cold drinks business, which flourished because there was no competition. It minted money from selling cold beverages like Gold Spot, Thums Up and Frooti, all of which became household names.'''
